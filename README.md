# Network Analysis With GeoJSON
## [ DEMO Link ] (http://www.alikilic.org/networkanalysis) 
We are meeting up again with a new project. I’m curious about your new job offers. Best wishes to meet big companies.

This library was produced for network analysis purpose. Produced for the control of natural gas pipelines. We are researching about which pipe the gas in the pipe passes through. Tested for more than 350 000 pipelines but we have some problems. Process lasts an average of 14 min for 350000 pipelines. in fact this is not just for pipelines. You can use for any linestring and polyline. if you are wondering about the important problem, please let me explain to big problem. If you work with a lot of data, your computer’s tech. features must be powerfull. you can watch your task manager or monitor during this process.

# Libraries
 - [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) used for get values DOM
 - [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) used for showing features on the map
 - [Turfjs](http://turfjs.org/) used for showing features on the map
 - [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) for Visual HTML
 - [Leaflet PM library](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm) for Drawing new Lines

## What you can do with my network analysis library?

 1. You can find snaped lines
 2. You can find unsnapped lines
 3. You can find shortest path use by Dijkstra’s Algorithm
 4. You can do snap unsnapped lines
 5. You can download result GeoJSON data

The open source enthusiasts can contact me to make this library even more advanced. I developed it with ES6. I will soon offer support in modular format.


## How to use

Class name is **geojsonNetworkAnalysis**

The constructor function needs two parameters, First parameter is featureCollection a GoeJSON data. Seccond parameter is for important variables

will be updated soon...
